# TeethSegmentation
<h1>Dental Radiograph Gap Detection</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/DUc1zF668RI)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to detect the gaps between upper and lower teeth as well as between teeth in dental radiographs using MATLAB. The method is based on the paper by Jain and Chen (2004) and employs techniques like contrast enhancement and line detection.

Files used:
1. teeth_sample1.png - Dental radiograph image for testing.
2. README.md - This file containing information about the project and its sources.

Code Sources:
1. Adaptive histogram equalization: [MATLAB documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/adaptive-histogram-equalization.html)

Instructions:
1. Run the MATLAB script provided.
2. Ensure the 'teeth_sample1.png' image is in the same directory as the script.
3. Adjust parameters as needed for better detection.
